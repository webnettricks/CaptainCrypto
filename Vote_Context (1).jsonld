    "comment": "Here’s my summary of what I’m voting for, based on the Cardano 2025 Budget Info Action, written as if I’m reviewing it myself and choosing to vote YES:\n\nI’m voting on a Cardano 2025 budget that allocates 7,568,810 ada to fund seven community-driven projects. This budget is part of a community-led, constitutionally guided process to spend Cardano’s treasury within a 350 million ada Net Change Limit, aiming to drive growth and hit the 2025 roadmap goals. After reviewing it, I’m voting YES because I believe these projects, backed by strong community support, will push Cardano forward.\n\nWhat’s in the Budget?\nThe budget funds these seven projects, each with over 2.69 billion ada in Ekklesia’s off-chain polling (50% + 1 Lovelace of the 5.38B active voting stake):\n\nMidgard - Optimistic Rollups (2.16M ada, 3.58B ada votes): Scales Cardano with rollup tech.\nStarstream: Next Gen VM (2M ada, 3.47B ada votes): A new virtual machine for better apps.\nBlockfrost Platform (1.3M ada, 3.19B ada votes): Tools to help developers build on Cardano.\nzkFold ZK Rollup (1.16M ada, 3.20B ada votes): Zero-knowledge rollups for faster, private transactions.\nHardware Wallets Maintenance (424,800 ada, 3.43B ada votes): Keeps wallets secure and updated.\nLedger App Rewrite (300,000 ada, 2.83B ada votes): Upgrades Cardano’s Ledger support.\nDolos: Lightweight Data Node (220,914 ada, 2.70B ada votes): Maintains a lean node for the network.\nTotal: 7,568,810 ada (~$4.16M at ~$0.55/ada). These are community projects, not from founding entities like Intersect, IOG, Cardano Foundation, or Emurgo, which must submit their own proposals separately.\n\nWhy I’m Voting YES\nThis budget is Cardano’s chance to live up to its Voltaire vision—decentralized, community-driven governance. With 3.92 billion ada cast in Ekklesia (72% of active voting power), the community showed up in force. Each project cleared a tough 2.69B ada threshold, proving they’ve got broad support. That gives me confidence I’m backing what the ecosystem wants.\n\nThe projects themselves hit key areas for 2025: scalability (rollups, VMs), developer support (Blockfrost, Dolos), and security (wallets, Ledger). These are the kinds of investments that can help Cardano compete with bigger chains and grow adoption. The budget’s small size (~2% of the 350M ada cap) means it’s not overreaching, and the Net Change Limit keeps spending in check.\n\nI also like how this budget fixes past governance hiccups. It only includes proposals that hit the proper 50% + 1 Lovelace threshold (2.69B ada of active stake), avoiding the risk of weak projects sneaking through on low turnout. Kicking out founding entities’ proposals ensures fairness—everyone plays by the same rules. Plus, Intersect’s role as administrator, with standardized submissions and public Ekklesia data, adds transparency, and the Constitutional Committee’s oversight (needing 5/7 votes) keeps it legit.\n\nMy Lingering Thoughts\nI’m not 100% worry-free. Some X posts mentioned Ekklesia’s clunky interface—DReps had trouble with online wallet requirements, which might’ve limited who voted. That’s a bummer, but 72% participation is still solid. I’m also curious why this budget is so focused and small compared to the 275M ada one I saw earlier. It’s not a dealbreaker, but I’ll want to see how it fits into the bigger picture.\n\nThere’s also a tiny market risk—7.5M ada is only ~0.03% of the 22.7B circulating supply, but I’m counting on Intersect to space out withdrawals to avoid price dips. And while Intersect’s running the show as administrator, the fact that they’re not funding their own projects here makes me feel better about their neutrality.\n\nMy Vote\nI’m voting YES on this Budget Info Action. These seven projects, backed by strong Ekklesia votes, are a smart bet to boost Cardano’s scalability, developer ecosystem, and security. The process feels fair, transparent, and aligned with the Constitution, and I’m excited to support community builders who might not have the 100k ada deposit to go it alone. This is a step toward the decentralized, thriving Cardano I want to see in 2025.\n\nI’ll stay active, though—watching Intersect’s fund management, checking the community dashboard for updates, and voting on treasury withdrawals to ensure every ada is well spent. If this passes, these projects could give Cardano a real edge, and I’m happy to help make that happen."
